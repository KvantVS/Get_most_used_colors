### Libs to install
`pip install Pillow`  
`pip install PyQt5`


#### P.S. Script with average colors
`get_most_colors_with_average_colors.py` doesn't seems to be usefull. I experimenting there with calculating average color in each color group and output it as result. But the colors are issued faded.
